0.4.2 2013-11-09T16:06:27Z
 [00 Bugfix]
 - Minimum perl declared is now 5.8, and tested to work on 5.8
 - However, the version scheme is x.y.z still, which means if you want to depend on a specific version in Perl code,
   you'll need a recent enough version.pm to make it work.

0.4.0 2013-10-01T22:51:43Z
 [00 API Backwards Incompatible Changes]
 - os_root property no longer exists, as is no longer required internally

 [Bugfixes]
 - Minor typo in POD ( Thanks David Steinbrunner )
 - Uplevel mechanism bugged on Win32, thanks zdm for reporting
 - Traversal Order is now test/iterate instead of iterate/test, meaning it will test / prior to terminating, useful
   probably if $PROJECTDIR is a UNC Share.
 - Root check now performed by a more reliable Path::Tiny->is_rootdir, xdg++ for the fixes.
 - Path resolution is now performed and realpathed early on.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.3.2, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - develop: +1 -1 (recommends: -1, suggests: +1 -1)
 - runtime: ↑1 -1

 [Tests]
 - Aggressively now checks that $PROJECTROOT/../ is not contained in a directory that is considered "dev" by
   Path::IsDev.
 - This is intended to smoke out quirks that exist on your filesystem, and on CPAN Testers file systems in general that
   exhibit wart-like behaviour to the Path::IsDev Heuristic sets.
 - If these tests fail for you, they'll probably result in Path::IsDev and Path::FindDev also being broken, so I
   greatly appreciate any reports regarding false-positives that could be logically anticipated to be false positives
   on all filesystems.
 - Otherwise, please read the Path::IsDev documentation and see how to mark a directory tree as a "NegativeHeuristic",
   namely, touch $PROBLEMDIR/.path_isdev_ignore
