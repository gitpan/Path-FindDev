Release history for Path-FindDev

0.4.0 2013-10-01T22:51:43Z
 [00 API Backwards Incompatible Changes]
 - os_root property no longer exists, as is no longer required internally

 [Bugfixes]
 - Minor typo in POD ( Thanks David Steinbrunner )
 - Uplevel mechanism bugged on Win32, thanks zdm for reporting
 - Traversal Order is now test/iterate instead of iterate/test, meaning it
   will test / prior to terminating, useful probably if $PROJECTDIR is a
   UNC Share.
 - Root check now performed by a more reliable Path::Tiny->is_rootdir,
   xdg++ for the fixes.
 - Path resolution is now performed and realpathed early on.

 [Tests]
 - Aggressively now checks that $PROJECTROOT/../ is not contained in a
   directory that is considered "dev" by Path::IsDev.
 - This is intended to smoke out quirks that exist on your filesystem, and
   on CPAN Testers file systems in general that exhibit wart-like behaviour
   to the Path::IsDev Heuristic sets.
 - If these tests fail for you, they'll probably result in Path::IsDev and
   Path::FindDev also being broken, so I greatly appreciate any reports
   regarding false-positives that could be logically anticipated to be
   false positives on all filesystems.
 - Otherwise, please read the Path::IsDev documentation and see how to mark
   a directory tree as a "NegativeHeuristic", namely, touch
   $PROBLEMDIR/.path_isdev_ignore
